Plumb Lab RIXS Data Analysis
============================

Here we keep the up to date analysis tools used for RIXS data analysis in Plumb Lab at Brown University. Each compound being analyzed and modeled will have its own folder in the repository. These folders will specifically have code meant to analyze experimental data relevant to that compound and/or significant modifications to the base code made for that compound <sup> ++</sup>.  

## Contributers:

* **PI:** Dr. Kemp Plumb
* Michael DiScala
* Jurre Wouters 

### Updates
 
Updates will be pushed/merged with the master repository on Friday evenings, with finalized checks on Sunday evening. The totality of the code will be provide a snapshot of the project's process from week to week. Each script will be fully compatible with every other script in the repository. Comments within the code will also be periodically updated when necessary. The majority of the changes made weekly will be logged into a changelog along with the date changes were made. 

#### Note <sup> ++ </sup>
Some code on here may be specifically made for use with specific experimental data, however the experimental data will **not** be pushed to the repository, so this code may require some editing to work with different experimental data
